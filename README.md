This is a website I made that should end up having 3 games on it. 

// the 1st game 
1.)Dragon Ball Pong - I ended up using javascript for this game and just did object oriented stuff for setup/ has the basic mechanics of pong but I implemented some diffent things
to make it nicer(spirtes, background, music, animations)/ I made a 1Player mode and 2Player mode to try and diversify the game a little and make it more interesting. 

// the 2nd game
2.) 

// the 3rd game
3.)
